## Summary
This app is relatively straightforward. It runs by using a fetch block that calls two separate APIs: one from YouTube, and the other from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). GBIF provides free access to biodiversity data. In this app, we're mainly utilizing it to pull scientific names of animals and other very basic general data that coincide with the search term provided by the user. YouTube is being used to pull up videos that coincide with the search term provided by the user. The ultimate goal for the app is to foster a level of curiosity about various animal species to hopefully inspire conservation efforts to protect the natural world.
Ex: User types a name into the search field (i.e. "tiger"). The app will pull up GBIF data of scientific names that contain the word 'tiger' for various animal species. The app will also display YouTube videos relating to the entered search term.
